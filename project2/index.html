<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<h4>By Marianne Pearce</h4>

<h2>Project Concept<h2>

<h3>For this project, the goal is to create a <u>user-friendly shopping website that focuses on the selling and shipment of fashionable clothes.</u> The goal of this website is to reach audiences that desire the aesthetic type of brand and receive money through purchasing and shipping. Catering to female audiences, the website will provide:</h3>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>A free range of clothing</li>
	<li>Categories of different clothes</li>
	<li>Descriptions of each clothing item</li>
</ul>

<h3>The objective for this website is to create a dynamic site for users to shop and browse on, as well as providing different ranges of clothing styles and categories, finally adding descriptions and details of each item for the audience to recite credibility and information about it. The key features that will be included are categories, images and detailed descriptions of clothing items.</h3>

<h2>Site Map</h2>

<h3>The website content will be organized into five pages, each being unique with helpful information for user’s to use at their disposal. There will also be five pages, each being:</h3>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Product/clothing item</li>
    <li>Clothing/Seasonal Deals</li>
    <li>Shopping cart</li>
    <li>User Account</li>
    <li>Company Contact Information</li>
</ol>

<h3>Users will be able to browse products, view their shopping cart, their account and how to contact the company within those organized pages. The homepage will be minimalist with a simple design so it won’t take away the main goal of the site. Too much design will overwhelm the user and lose focus on promoting clothing designs. Some sub-topics such as categories for certain clothing items will be added, deals and special sales, and account personalization and cart information. 

Navigation will be very fluid and dynamic, very easy as the icons and text will be <em>readable</em> and <em>noticeable.</em> There won’t be a lot for the user to learn as navigation will solely be based on scrolling and clicking. If there are too many icons and buttons, the user will get confused thus losing interest in the site.</h3>

<h2>Project Resources<h2>

<h3>SquareSpace offers a bunch of template designs that helped me reference and come up with my own. This is a very helpful source during design brainstorming. I will use it for inspiration during my project development.</h3>
